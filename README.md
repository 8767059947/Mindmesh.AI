## ⚙️ How It Works (Workflow)

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how Mindmesh.AI processes a typical request:

### 1. 🔐 User Authentication
- Users sign in using **Clerk** (email, social login, etc.)
- Auth token is attached to all backend API requests
- User data is securely stored and rate-limited as per plan (free/premium)

### 2. 🧾 Content or Image Submission
- Users choose a tool (e.g., Generate Resume, Remove Background)
- Input is provided via text form or image upload (via FilePond)

### 3. 🔁 Backend API Routing (Node.js + Express)
- Each tool has a corresponding API route (e.g., `/api/generate/resume`)
- Middleware verifies user auth, plan limits, and logs usage
- Input is validated and sent to the appropriate AI service

### 4. 🤖 AI Processing
- Text-based tools (blogs, resumes) use **OpenAI** or **Gemini Pro**
- Image-based tools call **Replicate** or **ClipDrop** APIs
- Prompts are dynamically crafted based on user input

### 5. ☁️ Cloud Storage & Delivery
- Final images are uploaded to **Cloudinary** for CDN delivery
- Generated content is returned directly as API response
- Optional: usage is logged to **Neon PostgreSQL**

### 6. 🎨 Frontend Rendering (React.js)
- Clean UI built using **Tailwind CSS**
- Users see results immediately (loading animation during API call)
- If logged in, results can optionally be saved for later use

📌 **Example:**  
If a user wants to remove an object from an image:  
→ They upload the image → API sends it to Replicate → Edited image is returned → Frontend shows before/after comparison.
